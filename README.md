# cdn
NCX Programming CDN, used for any files that are put up for download by us (excluding the source code dumps).
## Important
This repository is no longer updated, however, the site is still available, and at the same URL. I've migrated from GitHub Pages to an AWS S3 bucket for storage because it was more fitting. Every file path should still be the same.
